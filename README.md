# The Script

This is a tool to go with the book I wrote, The Script: Cold Reading for Mentalists

The program script.c makes it easier to memorize any script, not just the lines from my book.  It uses AI to watch how close you are to the exact answer, which means you don't have to worry about typos.  If you get an answer wrong it tells you the right answer and gives you the option of starting over at the beginning. It also uses symbols as a memory mnemonic to help remember each line in the script.

This code should compile easily using any C++ Compiler on Windows, Mac, or Linux. There is also a compiled Windows executable.
